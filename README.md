# Book Recommendation System

> Because life’s too short for bad books.

Welcome to the world of smart reading! This project builds a **Book Recommendation System** that helps users discover books they’ll love based on what others like them have read and rated. Whether you’re a data nerd, a bookworm, or both – this project has something to offer. 🌟

## 🔍 What This Project Does

This system recommends books using:
- **Popularity-based Filtering** – Want to read what’s trending? We've got you covered.
- **Collaborative Filtering** – Ever wondered what people with similar tastes are reading? We’ll tell you.

Using a rich dataset of books, users, and ratings, we build an intelligent system that *thinks before it recommends*.

## How It Works

1. **Data Collection**
   -  `Books.csv`: Book titles, authors, publishers, etc.
   -  `Users.csv`: User details like age and location.
   -  `Ratings.csv`: Who rated what, and how much?

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Cleaning, filtering out sparse data, and preparing for matrix operations.

3. **Recommendation Engine**
   - Popularity-Based: Top-rated books by vote count & average rating.
   - Collaborative Filtering: Cosine similarity between users/books.

4. **User Interface**
   - An interactive app (via `app.py`) to input your favorite books and get recommendations instantly.
